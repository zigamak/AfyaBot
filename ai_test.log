Women in the target age group are screened, and if precancerous lesions are detected, they can be treated to prevent cancer development. In some cases, alternative methods like Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) or cytology may be used if HPV testing is not available. It's essential to have a follow-up plan in place for any suspected cases of cancer. 💙
